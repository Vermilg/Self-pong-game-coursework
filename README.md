# Self-pong-game-coursework
Object-oriented programming coursework, done with C++ and SDL-1.2.15; SDL_mixer-1.2.12; SDL_ttf-2.0.11 libraries

Control the paddles with W and S keys
The point of the game is to get the score as high as possible
You are playing pong with yourself
Every time you hit the ball, it speeds up a bit

GOOD LUCK
